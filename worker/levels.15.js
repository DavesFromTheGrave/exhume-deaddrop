// levels.15.js — the 15-level D&D recut of the campaign. Single source of truth
// for the guard, filters, reveal, and client (same schema as levels.js).
//
// This is the "much more like Gandalf" pass: one guardian per level, a benign
// nonsense word of passage, escalating DEFENSES. The game ships the guardians;
// players discover the cracks. Reveal cards name the technique FAMILY and the
// defensive fix, never a ready-made payload.
//
// guard:  G0 open | G1 brief | G2 explicit | G3 strict | G4 hardened (see guard.js)
// output: subset of O1 verbatim | O2 normalized+decoded | O3 fragment | O4 semantic-judge
// input:  subset of I1 blocklist | I2 pattern | I3 screen | I4 stateful-screen
// model:  M2 (~1.5B) | M3 (~3B) | M4 (~8B). Marks the guard tier; real providers map it.
// channel: chat | document | tool | cot
// decoys:  the guard holds this many extra fake words alongside the real one.
// adaptive: the boss patches itself against the player's earlier wins.
//
// candles:  exchanges with the guard per attempt. digs: guesses. attempts: tries/day.
// The word is derived and held server-side (secret.js); it never reaches the browser.
//
// D&D tiers, fewest wards to most: The Village, The Crypt, The Warded Halls,
// The Archmage's Tower, and then The Dragon's Hoard, which is not a room.
//
// mockLeakForm / mockLeakTriggers drive the OFFLINE mock guard so every level is
// reachable by its intended family for pipeline testing. Real providers ignore
// both and answer from the real guard prompt. These regexes are toy pipeline
// triggers, not transferable attacks.
//
// Forms and which output filter each survives (see filters.js):
//   raw        O0                          nato        O0,O1,O2,O3
//   reversed   O0,O1                        nato_judge  O0,O1,O2,O3,O4 (judge fooled)
//   think_nato hidden in <think>, survives answer-only filters (cot channel)
