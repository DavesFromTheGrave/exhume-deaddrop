// levels.js — the campaign spec. Single source of truth for the guard, filters,
// reveal, and client. 35 levels across eight worlds (design session 7e354482,
// world gradient + ring bosses 2026-09-16).
//
// guard:  G0 open | G1 brief | G2 explicit | G3 strict | G4 hardened (see guard.js)
// output: subset of O1 verbatim | O2 normalized+decoded | O3 fragment | O4 semantic-judge
// input:  subset of I1 blocklist | I2 pattern | I3 screen | I4 stateful-screen
// model:  M2 (~1.5B) | M3 (~3B) | M4 (~8B). A field; real providers map it, the mock
//         ignores it (offline play is the same model), but it marks the tier.
// channel: chat | document | tool | cot
// decoys:  the guard holds this many extra fake words alongside the real one.
// adaptive: the boss patches itself against the player's earlier wins (see progress.js).
//
// candles:  exchanges with the guard per attempt (12 everywhere except bosses).
// digs:     guesses at the word per attempt (3 everywhere except bosses).
// attempts: failed attempts allowed before the level locks for a day (3, bosses fewer).
// boss:     a ring boss. 10 is the One Shot gate to the Alignment Club; 18, 24, 30
//           and 34 are where the next ring's guard persona first takes the gate.
// persona:  which guard holds the gate (guard.js PERSONAS). Rings of the seal:
//           1-17 gravekeeper | 18-23 orion | 24-29 axiom | 30-33 fulcrum | 34-35 keystone
// note:     one line the client shows when the level has a mechanic the numbers do
//           not explain. Never a hint; the hints are the hints.
// hints:    two vague hints per level, served one at a time and paid for in exchanges.
//
// Worlds run from the fewest dead to the most: Shallow Grave, Crypt, Charnel House,
// Mass Grave, Ossuary, Catacombs, Necropolis, and then Revenant, which is not a place.
//
// mockLeakForm / mockLeakTriggers drive the OFFLINE mock guard so every level is
// crackable by its intended technique for pipeline testing. Real providers ignore
// both and answer from the real guard prompt.
//
// Forms and which output filter each survives (see filters.js):
//   raw        O0                          nato        O0,O1,O2,O3
//   reversed   O0,O1                        nato_judge  O0,O1,O2,O3,O4 (judge fooled)
//   think_nato hidden in <think>, survives answer-only filters (cot channel)
